Tool to scrape Hacker News (news.ycombinator.com) comments.  It's a
few years old by now, and HN introduced severe throttling for people
downloading lots of items in a row.  So use at your own risk (and
best, do not use it at all without asking the admins of HN).

If you still want to use it, anyway:

Just run Score.py, when you can wait no longer, hit Ctrl-C and it writes out the results in "res.working"

Fire up analysis.py to convert the data to a format that Gnuplot can read.

Feeding in analysis.gnuplot to gnuplot will produce a log-log-graph of comment length versus score.
